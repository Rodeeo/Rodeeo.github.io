I failed!  I got to read through the notes and learn some great CSS stuff. 
Honestly this is the ONLY thing this semester that has made any sense to me. 
since thats the only class I have passed before getting here. 

BUT this week was full of Politcal stress that caused me to lose focus.

Now I am not going to apologize fully because what happened this week 
was more important than anything that could have happened this week. 
I was super lucky I got the group project finished since we meet on 
Wednesday. But everything after that was a panic induced stress watching
blue and red states change colors.
