                    global variables are variables that are created without using the const , let or var keywords. Global variables 
                    can be accessed in all parts of the program.
                    
                    The window.alert() method will pause the execution of the program and display a message in a dialog box. The 
                    message is provided as an argument to the method, and undefined is always returned:                    
                    window.alert('Hello');
                    << undefined
                    
                    The window.confirm() method will stop the execution of the program and display a confirmation dialog that shows 
                    the message provided as an argument, and giving the options of OK or Cancel. It returns the boolean values of 
                    true if the user clicks OK, and false if the user clicks Cancel:                    
                    window.confirm('Do you wish to continue?');
                    << undefined
                                        
                    The window.prompt() method will stop the execution of the program. It displays a dialog that shows a message provided as an argument, 
                    as well as an input field that allows the user to enter text. This text is then returned as a string when the user clicks OK. If the 
                    user clicks Cancel, null is returned:                    
                    window.prompt('Please enter your name:');
                                        
                    The write() method simply writes a string of text to the page. If a page has already loaded, it will completely replace the current 
                    document: The use of document.write() is heavily frowned upon                    
                    document.write('Hello, world!');
                    
                    Cookies are small files that are saved locally on a user’s computer. To create a cookie, you assign it to JavaScript’s “cookie jar”, 
                    using the document.cookie property, like so:                    
                    document.cookie = 'name=Superman';
                    << "name=Superman"
                    
                    The window object is the global object in a browser.                    
                    Global variables are actually properties of the window object in a browser environment.
                    alert , confirm() , and prompt() are all methods of the window object, and open dialogs that halt the execution of the program.
                    The window.navigator object gives information about the user’s browser and operating system, although it can be unreliable.
                    The window.location object provides information about the URL of the current page.
                    The window.history object keeps information about the pages that have been visited in the session.
                    The window.screen object provides information about the user’s screen.
                    document.write() is an archaic method of writing text to the document and should be avoided.
                    Cookies can be used to store small pieces of information between requests using the document.cookie property.
                    The window.setTimeout() method can be used to invoke a function after a set amount of time. It can 
                    be canceled using the clearTimeout() method.
                    The window.setInterval() method can be used to repeatedly invoke a function. It can be stopped using 
                    the clearInterval() method.
                    The window.requestAnimationFrame() method can be used to produce smooth and optimized animation by
                    utilizing the browser's built-in graphics capabilities. It can be canceled using the cancelAnimationFrame() method.

    Ch14: HTML5 APIs.
    The data- attribute is a way of embedding data in a 
    web page using custom attributes that are ignored by 
    the browser. 
    
    The Web Storage API provides a key-value store on the 
    client’s computer that is similar to using cookies but 
    has fewer restrictions, more storage capacity, and is 
    generally easier to use. This makes it perfect for storing 
    information about users, as well as storing application-
    specific information that can then be used during 
    future sessions.
    
    
    The Service Worker API allows a worker script to run in the background with the 
    added benefit of being able to intercept network requests. This allows you to 
    take alternative action if the network is offline, and effectively create app-like 
    offline experiences
    There are a large number of different examples of using the Service Worker API 
    in The Service Worker Cookbook https://serviceworke.rs/
    
    
    The canvas element was introduced to allow graphics to be drawn 
    onto a web page in real time using JavaScript.
    
    HTML5.1 is the latest incarnation of the Hypertext Markup Language. It covers a variety of technologies, 
    including several APIs that are accessible using JavaScript.
    
     data- attributes help to embed custom data into a web page that can then be used to enhance the user 
     experience with JavaScript.
    
    The Web Storage API allows key-value pairs to be stored on the user’s device in a similar way to cookies,
    but without the same storage restrictions.
    
    The Geolocation API allows you to access the geographic coordinates of the user’s device, as long as the 
    user gives permission.
    
    The Web Worker API can be used to perform computationally intensive tasks in the background, which helps 
    to avoid websites becoming unresponsive.
    
    Websockets are a new protocol for communicating over the internet, and allow real-time, two-way communication.
    
    The Notification API allows you to display notifications on the user's system.
    
    The <audio> and <video> elements can be employed to embed audio tracks and video clips in a web page. 
    They also have a Media API that can help control the playback using JavaScript.
    
    The canvas element can be used to dynamically draw geometric shapes, text, and images on a web page 
    in real-time using JavaScript.
    
    A shim or polyfill is a piece of code that adds support of missing features to older browsers.
