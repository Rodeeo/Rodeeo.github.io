                <h3>Ch10: Testing and Debugging</h3>
 <pre>  I love fixing things. It brings me joy to resolve something for someone. 
So, testing and debugging is right up ally.
Strict Mode - produces more exceptions and warnings and prohibits the use of some deprecated features. 
Not using strict mode is often referred to as 'sloppy mode' as itâ€™s forgiving of sloppy programming practices.
'use strict';
function strictly(){
    'use strict';
    // function code goes here
(function() {
    'use strict';
    // All your code would go inside this function  }()); 
js modules are self-contained pieces of code that are in strict mode by default. 
js Checkers: <a href="http://jslint.com">JS Lint</a>, <a href="https://jshint.com">JS Hint</a>, <a href="https://eslint.org">ES Lint</a>

try , catch , and finally -
try block. This will run the code inside the block as normal -> catch block
catch block will only run if an exception is thrown inside the try block. -> finally block
This will always be executed after the try or catch block, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not. 
It is useful if you want some code to run in both cases.

Test-driven development(TDD) is the process of writing tests before any actual code.(good luck getting someone to pay for this)

    function imaginarySquareRoot(number) {
    'use strict';
    let answer;
    try {
        answer = String(squareRoot(number));
    } catch(error) {
        answer = squareRoot(-number)+"i";
    } finally {
        return `+ or - ${answer}`;
    }
    } </pre>

                <pre>Start off taking the array given in the js and reorgainizing it to work better. The controller pattern. 
OH MAN this was butal. So, I got to drive this week and spent every hour possible trying to wrap my head around these very
complex things. Luckily my group has some really smart guys and we all walked through the code together. I still don't think
I could write it from scratch myself but I do understand it now. 
Single Page Application - I wish I had known this before hand. 
I had no idea what a single page aplication was before this. I didn't know it was possible. Had I known going into it it 
would have changed everything for me. Not sure where I was supposed to learn it, but I must have missed that part. 
I enjoyed playing with this.

                <img src= "images/MVC-Process.svg">
                <pre>the controller pattern MV* 
    MVC model view controller: model, controller, view
    Model - the brain - respoinsible for getting data: (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
    View - the html/css - communicates with the controller. can get dynamic values from the controller
    Controller - gets user input. processes requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) gets data from the model. 
    passes data to the view. 
    Model = where to save the data 
    View = displaying data 
    Controller = where to message the data before you display</pre>
