<pre id="words">
    The Fetch API provides a JavaScript interface for accessing and manipulating parts of the HTTP pipeline, such as requests and responses. 
    It also provides a global fetch() method that provides an easy, logical way to fetch resources asynchronously across the network.

    This kind of functionality was previously achieved using XMLHttpRequest. Fetch provides a better alternative that can be easily used by other 
    technologies such as Service Workers. Fetch also provides a single logical place to define other HTTP-related concepts such as CORS and extensions to HTTP.
    
    The fetch specification differs from jQuery.ajax() in three main ways:    
    The Promise returned from fetch() won’t reject on HTTP error status even if the response is an HTTP 404 or 500. Instead, it will resolve normally (with ok 
    status set to false), and it will only reject on network failure or if anything prevented the request from completing.
    fetch() won't can receive cross-site cookies; you can’t can establish a cross site session using fetch. Set-Cookie headers from other sites are silently ignored.
    fetch won’t send cookies, unless you set the credentials init option. (Since Aug 25, 2017. The spec changed the default credentials policy to same-origin. 

    1 fetch('http://example.com/movies.json')
    2 .then(response => response.json())
    3 .then(data => console.log(data));

    The fetch() method can optionally accept a second parameter, an init object that allows you to control a number of different settings.

    Polyfill - To use Fetch in unsupported browsers, there is a Fetch Polyfill available that recreates the functionality for non-supporting browsers.

            <h3> MDN: Validating forms</h3>
<pre>
    Form validation. When you enter data, the browser and/or the web server will check to see that the data is in the correct format and within 
    the constraints set by the application. Validation done in the browser is called client-side validation, while validation done on the server 
    is called server-side validation. In this chapter we are focusing on client-side validation.

    If the information is correctly formatted, the application allows the data to be submitted to the server and (usually) saved in a database; 
    if the information isn't correctly formatted, it gives the user an error message explaining what needs to be corrected, and lets them try again.

    2 Types of client-side validation

    Built-in form validation: It uses HTML5 form validation doesn't require much JavaScript. Built-in form validation has better performance than 
    JavaScript, but it is not as customizable.

    JavaScript validation is coded using JavaScript. This validation is completely customizable, but you need to create it all (or use a library).
    The Constraint Validation API
    Most browsers support the Constraint Validation API, which consists of a set of methods and properties available on the following form element DOM interfaces:
    HTMLButtonElement (represents a < button> element)
    HTMLFieldSetElement (represents a < fieldset> element)
    HTMLInputElement (represents an < input> element)
    HTMLOutputElement (represents an < output> element)
    HTMLSelectElement (represents a < select> element)
    HTMLTextAreaElement (represents a < textarea> element)

    Implementing a customized error message
    As you saw in the HTML5 validation constraint examples earlier, each time a user tries to submit an invalid form, the browser displays an error message. 
    The way this message is displayed depends on the browser.  If you want a customized responce it needs to be js validation.
