Memoization - 
A useful feature of this is that it provides result caching, or memoization

A recursive function is one that invokes itself until a certain condition is met. 
It’s a useful tool to use when iterative processes are involved.

Immediately Invoked Function Expression– or IIFE – (pronounced 'iffy') is an anonymous
function that, as the name suggests, is invoked as soon as it’s defined. This is easily 
achieved by placing parentheses at the end of the function definition (remember we use 
parentheses to invoke a function). The function also has to be made into an expression, 
which is done by placing the whole declaration inside parentheses

Callback hell is the term used to refer to this tangled mess of code, and it's such a 
common issue that it evenhas its own website! All my code is hell.

            <h3>Ch13: AJAX</h3>
<pre>
The Fetch API provides a global fetch() method that only has one mandatory argument, 
which is the URL of the resource you wish to fetch. A very basic example would look 
something like the following piece of code:
fetch('https://example.com/data')
.then( // code that handles the response )
.catch( // code that runs if the server returns an error )

headers – A Headers object (see later section) containing any headers associated with the response
url – A string containing the URL of response
redirected – A boolean value that specifies if the response is the result of a redirect
mode – Allows you to specify if CORS is used or not. CORS is enabled by default.
cache – Allows you to specify how the request will use the browser's cache. 
credentials – Lets you specify if cookies should be allowed with the request.
redirect – Specifies what to do if the response returns a redirect.
