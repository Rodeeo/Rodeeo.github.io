                <h3>Ch5: Objects</h3>
                <pre>
    Functions are first-class objects that behave the same way as other values.

    Function literals can be defined using the function declaration, or by creating afunction expressionby assigning an anonymous function to a variable.
    
    All functions return a value. If this is not explicitly stated, the function will return undefined.
    
    A parameter is a value that is written in the parentheses of a function declaration and can be used like a variable inside the function’s body.
    
    An argument is a value that is provided to a function when it is invoked.
    
    The arguments variable is an array-like object that allows access to each argument provided to the function using index notation.
    
    The rest operator can be used to access multiple arguments as an array.
    
    Default arguments can be supplied to a function by assigning them to the parameters.
    
    Arrow functions are a new shorthand notation that can used for writing anonymous functions in ES6.
    
    Function declarations can be invoked before they are defined because they are hoisted to the top of the scope, but function expressions cannot be invoked until after they are defined.
    
    Acallbackis a function that is provided as an argument to another function.

            <h3>Ch6: Document Object Model</h3>
<pre>
    The Document Object Model is a way of representing a page of HTML as a tree of nodes.

    The document.getElementById() , document.getElementsByClassName() , document.getElementsByTagNames() and document.querySelector() can be used to access elements on a page.
    
    The parentNode() , previousSibling() , nextSibling() , childNodes() and children() methods can be used to navigate around the DOM tree.
    
    An element’s attributes can be accessed using the getAttribute() method, and updated using the setAttribute() method.
    
    The createElement() and createTextNode() methods can be used to create dynamic markup on the fly.
    
    Markup can be added to the page using the appendChild() and insertBefore() methods.
    
    Elements can be replaced using the replaceChild() method, and removed using the removeChild() method.
    
    The innerHTML property can be used to insert raw HTML directly into the DOM.
    
    The CSS properties of an element can be changed by accessing the style property.

            <h3>Ch7: Events</h3>
            <pre>
    Events occur when a user interacts with a web page.

    An event listener is attached to an element, then invokes a callback function when the event occurs.
    
    The event object is passed to the callback function as an argument, and contains lots of properties and methods relating to the event.
    
    There are many types of event, including mouse events, keyboard events, and touch events.
    
    You can remove an event using the removeEventListener method.
    
    The default behavior of elements can be prevented using the preventDefault() function.
    
    Event propagation is the order the events fire on each element.
    
    Event delegation is when an event listener is added to a parent element to capture events that happen to its children elements.
