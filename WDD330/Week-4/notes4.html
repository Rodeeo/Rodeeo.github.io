                <h3>Ch8: Forms</h3>
                <p>It just blows my mind the amount of knowledge that we try to keep in our heads. I mastered forms a few semesters ago and figured this would be like hopping on a bike.
                    NOPE. I was shocked how much I forgot and how mand details there are to it. I enjoyed this exercize and was happy to have it done. also I spent a full hour trying to figure out 
                    how I bricked my code only to find out that I had my main.js file declaired in the head and after the body. I was so angry.

                <h3>Ch12: Object Oriented Programming.</h3>
                <p> No this was a chapter that was just full of knowledge and info unlike the last one that was more example based. WHICH I love. I have a hard time learning
                    if I am not using my hands and figuring out peices for myself. I can't believe how much info is in this one chapter. 
                    <p>Object-oriented programming = A style of programming that involves separating the code into objects that have properties and methods.
                    OOP concepts: encapsulation, polymorphism and inheritance.     </p>            
                    <p>Encapsulation = keeping all the programming logic inside an object and making methods available to implement the functionality, without the outside world needing to knowhowit’s done.</p>
                    <p>Polymorphism = various objects can share the same method, but also have the ability to override shared methods with a more specific implementation.</p>
                    <p>Inheritance = means we can take an object that already exists and inherit all its properties and methods. We can then improve on its functionality by adding new properties and methods.</p>
                    <p>Prototypes =  It turns out that you can still do this using theprototypeproperty of the class. This is particularly useful if you don't have access to the class declaration, but still want to add properties and methods to the class.
                    All classes and constructor functions have a prototype property that returns an object:Create a class declaration that deals with any initialization, shared properties and methods.
                    Any extra methods and properties that need to be augmented to the class declaration after it’s been defined can be added to the prototype. These will be added toallinstances, even those that have already been created.
                    Add any properties or methods that are individual to a particular instance can be augmented using assignment to that object (a mixin could be used to add multiple properties at once, as we’ll see later).
                    Be careful when overwriting the prototype completely ― the constructor class needs to be reset.
                    It is possible to add more methods to the prototype of JavaScript’s built-in objects — such as Number , String , and Array — to add more functionality. This practice is known asmonkey-patching, 
                    but it’s mostly frowned upon in the JavaScript community, despite it being an incredibly powerful technique (The Ruby programming community, on the other hand, generally embrace monkey-patching, so it is quite common in Ruby code examples.</p>
                    <p>Property Attributes and Descriptors 
                    We’ve already seen that all objects are collections of key-value paired properties. It turns out that each property has a number of attributes that provide information about the property. These attributes are stored in a property descriptor, which is an object that contains values of each attribute.
                    All object properties have the following attributes stored in a property descriptor:
                    value ― This is the value of the property and is undefined by default
                    writable ― This boolean value shows whether a property can be changed or not, and is false by default
                    enumerable ― this boolean value shows whether a property will show up when the object is displayed in a for in loop, and is false by default
                    configurable ― this boolean value shows whether you can delete a property or change any of its attributes, and is false by default.</p>
                    <p>A mixin is a way of adding properties and methods of some objects to another object without using inheritance. It allows more complex objects to be created by ‘mixing’ basic objects together.
                    The bind() method is a method for all functions and is used to set the value of this in the function.
                    t’s possible to borrow methods from objects without having to inherit all their properties and methods. This is done by making a reference to the function that you want to borrow (that is, without parentheses so that it isn’t invoked).
                    For example, the batman object doesn’t have any of the superpower methods that the superman object has, but we can create a reference to them that can then be used by another object. For example, we can create a fly() function by referencing the superman object’s fly method:</p>

                <h3>Ch15: Modern Javascript - Modular Javascript</h3>
                <p>Module= module is a self-contained piece of code that provides functions and methods that can then be used in other files and by other modules.  
                    helps keep code organized, very efficient and able to have code hidden for exerntal API. 
                    I like this description: A module is nothing more than a chunk of JavaScript code written in a file.

                    ES6 Modules =
                    ES modules can be loaded dynamically via the import() function
                    Node.js Modules =  
                    Node v12, support for ES modules is enabled by default. Files including node modules must either end in .mjs or the nearest package.json file must contain "type": "module".
